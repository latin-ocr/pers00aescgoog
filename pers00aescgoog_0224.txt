‘⁶ We cordially commend this work. lt displays not only ¹

clearness os style and of arrangement, but also a high power
of combination, and where the author treats of philosophica]
questions, a sound and sensible philosophy.”—Times.

“ Affording, as it does, illustratione of prophecy as well
as concurrent testimonies in Biblical history, and presenting
in its method of treatment and its results, qualities which
deserve entire reliance, this work claims a place in the
libi-ary of every collegiate institution and of every scriptural
student.”-Britislt Quarterly Review.

“ This is not only the best history of Egypt which we
possess, but, taking into consideration the recent light that
has been thrown upon the subject, and the obsolete cha-
racter of all former histories, we may say that it is the only
one.”—Kitto’s Journal os Saefied Literature.

“ The Author displays a wide and sound acquaintance
with his subject, a critical judgment, and the power of
vivifying the past by description.’'—Spectator.

“ This is a remarkably lucid, comprehensive, and concise
history of old Egypt. The Author brings to his task a
singular clearness of perception, a most accurate habit of
investigation, united with a calm intellectual poise which

eminently adapts him for his office.”-Literary World
(New Y orla).
