WORKS ΟΝ ANCIENT HISTORY

BY
THE REV. JOHN KENRIOK, M.A.

1.
PHOENICIA.

One vol. 8vo. 16⁸.

“ He has given us a most thorough and complete critical
rdsume of all that can as yet be known about the Phoeni-
cians 3 and he has placed within reach of the English reader
from the advanced point of view of modern learning, an-
other very valuable contribution to the exact knowledge of
Ancient History‚ which he has already enriched by his two
volumes on ‘Egypt under the Pharaohs,' and by his
admirable and philosophical ‘ Essay on Primaeval History.'
For scholars who can appreciate the depth and accuracy
of learning which it displays‚ this work will possess a
peculiar value, as bringing before them in a form at once
brief and comprehensive, the collective results of a thorough
critical examination of all our existing sources of informa-
tion respecting one of the most curious and important
peoples of the ancient world.''——National Review.

“ A work of a similar cast and written in a similar spirit
to his ‘ Ancient Egypt,' based on profound but unpretending
learning, pervaded by an honest earnestness of purpose,
unalloyed with party feeling, fearless in inquiry, yet re-
markable for soundness of judgment. It is unquestionably
. an acquisition to archaeological literature.’'—Atltenoeum.

‘⁸ We heartily recommend this book to our readers, as
not only being the best, or indeed the only thoroughly
good English work on Phoenicia, but as being rich in
instructive matter for the merchant and manufacturer of
the present day, no less than for the student of antiquity.’'
